# Gemini-ai-chatbot
This project is an AI-powered chatbot built using Google Gemini API and Python.
It allows users to interact with a conversational AI model (Gemini flash 2.0) capable of understanding natural language and generating human-like responses in real time.

The chatbot can be run directly from the terminal or integrated into a GUI or web application.
